# TASK

Implement `imi go [fuzzySearch]`

## Description

The `go` command allows users to quickly navigate to a directory by providing a fuzzy search term. The command searches through all the host's iMi repos and worktrees to find the best match for the provided term and changes to that directory in the terminal.
