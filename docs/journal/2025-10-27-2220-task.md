# TASK

Implement `iMi close`

## Requirements

- This command cancels the branch by deleting the worktree without merging it into its target (main by default)

- Changes current directory to the trunk (trunk-main by default)

- The worktree dir is deleted

- The iMi db is updated to reflect the branch is no longer on the host
